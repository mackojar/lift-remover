Remove lifts data from alpine ski activity trace.

Supports FIT file generated by Strava mobile app.

TODO:
- update generator app details in output file (aren't app id's predefined? Can we do that?)
- wrong altitude gain in processed file: verify with Strava support?
- add unit tests
- to verify: sample file: some lift traffic stays at the very end: why?
- verify if input FIT file is of type "Alpine ski"
- add parameters:
  - output file name (currently hardcoded test.fit output file name)
  - operation mode (display only, remove lifts)
